# Vinyl Collection API

Welcome to the Record Collection API! This API serves as a backend for the Record Collection App, providing access to data about my personal vinyl collection. Built using Node.js and Express, it connects to a database hosted on [Turso](https://turso.tech/).

To retrieve the data and store it in the database, I used some scrapping scripts written in NodeJS using Cheerio and Puppeteer. You can have a look at the code in this [repo](https://github.com/pepedeulloa/vinylCollectionUtils).
